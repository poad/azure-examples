  You can find all prebuilt providers on yarn: https://www.yarnjs.com/search?q=keywords:cdktf
  You can also install these providers directly through yarn:

  yarn install @cdktf/provider-aws
  yarn install @cdktf/provider-google
  yarn install @cdktf/provider-azurerm
  yarn install @cdktf/provider-docker
  yarn install @cdktf/provider-github
  yarn install @cdktf/provider-null

  You can also build any module or provider locally. Learn more https://cdk.tf/modules-and-providers
